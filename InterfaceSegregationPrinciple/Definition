Interface Segregation Principle:
                              Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.The goal of this principle is to reduce the side effects of using 
  larger interfaces by breaking application interfaces into smaller ones. We should segregate Interface in such a way that classes that implement this interface should have all 
  the functionalities mentioned in the Interface. If it doesnot have any functionalities of interface then the Interface should be segreagated.
