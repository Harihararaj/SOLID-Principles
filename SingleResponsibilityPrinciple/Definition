SingleResponsibilityPrinciple
                          Single Responsibility Principle states that each class should handle only one responsibilty for the easy maintaince of code. If it handles more than  
one responsibility then the complexity of that particular class grows and that particular class cannot be reused in the future and maintainancy of such class is very complex.
Hence it is always good to handle one responsiblity in each class.
