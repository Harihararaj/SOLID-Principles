  
Liskov Substition Principle:
                        The Liskov Substitution Principle principle states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking 
the application.That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.The subclass should have all the features of the 
superclass.
