OpenForExtensionClosedForModification:
                                   Open/Closed principle states that code should be open for extension and closed for modification means that the code we write should
incorporate additional new features by Extending the already exsisting code not by Modifying the previously available code. This helps to prevent unnecessary breakdown 
of code. If we try to modify the already exsisting code we donot know the proper logic how it has been written if even make a small change it may reflect back in a complex way
